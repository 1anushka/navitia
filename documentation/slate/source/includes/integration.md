Navitia documentation: v1 interface
===================================

Overview
--------

This document describes how to call navitia via the v1 interface, and
the returned resources. You can read our lexicon at
<https://github.com/OpenTransport/vocabulary/blob/master/vocabulary.md>

### Endpoint

The only endpoint of this version of the api is :
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/>

See [authentication](#authentication) section to find out **how to use your token**.

If you use a web browser, you only have to paste it in the user area,
with no password. Or, in a simplier way, you can add your token in the
address bar like :
https://*my-token-is-mine-and-i-will-never-clearly-give-it*@api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks

### Some easy examples

- Geographical coverage of the service > https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage
- Where am I? (WGS 84 coordinates)
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coord/2.377310;48.847002
    - I'm on the "/fr-idf" coverage, at "20, rue Hector Malot in Paris, France"
- Which services are available on this coverage? Let's take a look at the links at the bottom of this stream
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf
- Networks available? (see what [network](#network) is)
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks
    - pwooo, many networks on this coverage ;)
- Is there any Metro lines or networks?
    - there is an api for that. See [pt_objects](#pt-objects)
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/pt_objects?q=metro
    - Response contain one network, one mode, and many lines
- Let's try some filtering (see [ptreferential](#ptreferential))
    - filter on the specific metro network ("id": "network:OIF:439" extracted from last request)
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks/network:OIF:439/
    - physical modes managed by this network
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks/network:OIF:439/physical_modes
    - metro lines
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks/network:OIF:439/physical_modes/physical_mode:Metro/lines
- By the way, what stuff are close to me?
    - https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/coords/2.377310;48.847002/places_nearby
    - or https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/coords/2.377310;48.847002/lines

Authentication
--------------

You must authenticate to use **navitia.io**. When you register we give
you a authentication key to the API.

You must use the [Basic HTTP
authentication](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#section-2), where the
username is the key, and without password.

Paging
------

All response contains a paging object

|Key|Type|Description|
|---|----|-----------|
|items_per_page|int|Number of items per page|
|items_on_page|int|Number of items on this page|
|start_page|int|The page number|
|total_result|int|Total number of items for this request|

You can navigate through a request with 2 parameters

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|---------|----|-----------|
|start_page|int|The page number|
|count|int|Number of items per page|

Interface
---------

We aim to implement [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
concept with Navitia.

Each response contains a linkable object and lots of links. Links allow
you to know all accessible uris and services for a given point.

### Templated url

Under some link sections, you will find a "templated" property. If
"templated" is true, then you will have to format the link with one id.

For example, in response of
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines> you will find a
*links* section:

``` json
{
    "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/{lines.id}/stop_schedules",
    "rel": "route_schedules",
    "templated": true
}
```

You have to put one line id instead of "{lines.id}". For example:
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/line:OIF:043043001:N1OIF658/stop_schedules>

### Inner references

Some link sections look like

``` json
{
    "internal": true,
    "type": "disruption",
    "id": "edc46f3a-ad3d-11e4-a5e1-005056a44da2",
    "rel": "disruptions",
    "templated": false
}
```

That means you will find inside the same stream ( *"internal": true* ) a
"disruptions" section ( *"rel": "disruptions"* ) containing some
disruptions objects ( *"type": "disruption"* ) where you can find the
details of your object ( *"id": "edc46f3a-ad3d-11e4-a5e1-005056a44da2"*
).

Apis
----

### Coverage (/coverage)

You can easily navigate through regions covered by navitia.io, with the
coverage api. The only arguments are the ones of [paging](#paging).

### Inverted geocoding (/coord)

Very simple service: you give Navitia some coordinates, it answers you
where you are:

-   your detailed postal address
-   the right Navitia "coverage" which allows you to access to all known
    local mobility services

For example, you can request navitia with a WGS84 coordinate as:

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coord/2.37691590563854;48.8467597481174>

In response, you will get the coverage id, a very useful label and a
ressource id:

``` json
{
    "regions": [
        "fr-idf"
    ],
    "address": {
    ...,
    "label": "20 Rue Hector Malot (Paris)",
    ...,
    "id": "2.37691590564;48.8467597481"
},
```

The coverage id is *"regions": ["fr-idf"]* so you can ask Navitia on
accessible local mobility services:

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/>

``` json
{
    "regions": [{
            "status": "running",
            "start_production_date": "20150804","end_production_date": "20160316",
            "id": "fr-idf"
            }],
    "links": [
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/coords"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/places"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/physical_modes"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/companies"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/commercial_modes"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/routes"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/stop_areas"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/stop_points"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/line_groups"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/connections"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/vehicle_journeys"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/poi_types"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/pois"},
        {"href": "http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/"}
        ]
}
```

### Public transportation objects exploration (/networks or /lines or /routes...)

Once you have selected a region, you can explore the public
transportation objects easily with these apis. You just need to add at
the end of your url a collection name to see all the objects of a
particular collection. To see an object add the id of this object at the
end of the collection's url. The [paging](#paging) arguments may be used to
paginate results.

#### Collections

-   networks
-   lines
-   routes
-   stop_points
-   stop_areas
-   commercial_modes
-   physical_modes
-   companies
-   vehicle_journeys

#### Specific parameters

There are other specific parameters.

##### "depth"

This tiny parameter can expand Navitia power by making it more wordy.
Here is some examples around "metro line 1" from the Parisian network:

- Get "line 1" id
	- https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/pt_objects?q=metro%201
	- The id is "line:OIF:100110001:1OIF439"
- Get routes for this line
	- https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/line:OIF:100110001:1OIF439/routes
- Want to get a tiny response? Just add "depth=0"
	- https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/line:OIF:100110001:1OIF439/routes?depth=0
	- The response is lighter (parent lines disappear for example)
- Want more informations, just add "depth=2"
	- https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/line:OIF:100110001:1OIF439/routes?depth=2
	- The response is a little more verbose (with some geojson appear in response)
- Wanna fat more informations, let's try "depth=3"
	- https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines/line:OIF:100110001:1OIF439/routes?depth=3
	- Big response: all stop_points are shown
- Wanna spam the internet bandwidth? Try "depth=42"
	- No. There is a technical limit with "depth=3"

##### odt level

-   Type: String
-   Default value: all
-   Warning: works ONLY with /lines collection...

It allows you to request navitia for specific pickup lines. It refers to
the [odt](#odt) section. "odt_level" can take one of these values:

*NEW! after 1.18 versions, this parameter is more accurate*

-   all (default value): no filter, provide all public transport lines,
    whatever its type
-   scheduled : provide only regular lines (see the [odt](#odt) section)
-   with_stops : to get regular, "odt_with_stop_time" and "odt_with_stop_point" lines.
    -   You can easily request route_schedule and stop_schedule with these kind of lines.
    -   Be aware of "estimated" stop times
-   zonal : to get "odt_with_zone" lines with non-detailed trips

For example

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-nw/networks/network:lila/lines>

<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-nw/networks/network:Lignes18/lines?odt_level=scheduled>

##### distance

-   Type: Integer
-   Default value: 200

If you specify coords in your filter, you can modify the radius used for
the proximity search.
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/coords/2.377310;48.847002/stop_schedules?distance=500>

##### headsign

-   Type: String

If given, add a filter on the vehicle journeys that has the given value
as headsign (on vehicle journey itself or at a stop time).

Examples:

-   <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/vehicle_journeys?headsign=CANE>
-   <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/stop_areas?headsign=CANE>

Warning: this last request gives the stop areas used by the vehicle
journeys containing the headsign CANE, *not* the stop areas where it
exists a stop time with the headsign CANE.

##### since / until

-   Type: datetime

To be used only on "vehicle_journeys" collection, to filter on a
period. Both parameters "until" and "since" are optional.

Example:

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr_idf/vehicle_journeys?since=20150912T120000&until=20150913T110000>

Warning: this filter is applied using only the first stop time of a
vehicle journey, "since" is included and "until" is excluded.

#### Filter

It is possible to apply a filter to the returned collection, using
"filter" parameter. If no object matches the filter, a "bad_filter"
error is sent. If filter can not be parsed, an "unable_to_parse" error
is sent. If object or attribute provided is not handled, the filter is
ignored.

##### line.code

It allows you to request navitia objects referencing a line whose code
is the one provided, especially lines themselves and routes.

Examples :

-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/lines?filter=line.code=4>
-   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/routes?filter=line.code>="métro
    347"

#### Examples

### Public Transport objects autocomplete (/pt_objects)

This api search in public transport objects via their names. It's a kind
of magical autocomplete on public transport data. It returns, in
addition of classic objects, a collection of [places](#place).

#### How does it works

Differents kind of objects can be returned (sorted as):

-   network
-   commercial_mode
-   line
-   route
-   stop_area

Here is a typical use case. A traveler has to find a line between the
1500 lines around Paris. Without any filters:

-   traveler input: "bob"
    -   network : "bobby network"
    -   line : "bobby bus 1"
    -   line : "bobby bus 2"
    -   route : "bobby bus 1 to green"
    -   route : "bobby bus 1 to rose"
    -   route : "bobby bus 2 to yellow"
    -   stop_area : "...
-   traveler input: "bobby met"
    -   line : "bobby metro 1"
    -   line : "bobby metro 11"
    -   line : "bobby metro 2"
    -   line : "bobby metro 3"
    -   route : "bobby metro 1 to Martin"
    -   route : "bobby metro 1 to Mahatma"
    -   route : "bobby metro 11 to Marcus"
    -   route : "bobby metro 11 to Steven"
    -   route : "...
-   traveler input: "bobby met 11" or "bobby metro 11"
    -   line : "bobby metro 11"
    -   route : "bobby metro 11 to Marcus"
    -   route : "bobby metro 11 to Steven"

in addition of classic objects, a collection of [places](#place) . This api is
very useful to make some autocomplete stuff.

Differents kind of objects can be returned (sorted as):

-   administrative_region
-   stop_area
-   poi
-   address
-   stop_point (appears only if specified, using "&type[]=stop_point"

    -   <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/places?q=paris>
-   then pois nearby this city
    -   <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/places/admin:7444/places_nearby>

### Journeys (/journeys)

This api computes journeys.

If used within the coverage api, it will retrieve the next journeys from
the selected public transport object or coordinates.

There are two ways to access this api.

The first one is: https://api.navitia.io/v1/{a_path_to_resource}/journeys it will
retrieve all the journeys from the resource (*isochrones*).

The other one, the most used, is to access the 'journey' api endpoint:
https://api.navitia.io/v1/journeys?from={resource_id_1}&to={resource_id_2}&datetime={datetime} .

<aside class="notice">
    Note
    <br><br>

    Navitia.io handle lot's of different data sets (regions). Some of them
    can overlap. For example opendata data sets can overlap with private
    data sets.
    <br><br>

    When using the journeys endpoint the data set used to compute the
    journey is chosen using the possible datasets of the origin and the
    destination.
    <br><br>

    For the moment it is not yet possible to compute journeys on different
    data sets, but it will one day be possible (with a cross-data-set
    system).
    <br><br>

    If you want to use a specific data set, use the journey api within the
    data set: https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/{your_dataset}/journeys
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
    Note
    <br><br>

    Neither the 'from' nor the 'to' parameter of the journey are required,
    but obviously one of them has to be provided.
    <br><br>

    If only one is defined an isochrone is computed with every possible
    journeys from or to the point.

### Traffic reports and disruptions (/traffic_reports)

This service provides the state of public transport traffic. It can be
called for an overall coverage or for a specific object.

#### Parameters

You can access it via that kind of url: https://api.navitia.io/v1/{a_path_to_a_resource}/traffic_reports

For example:

-   overall public transport traffic report on Ile de France coverage
    -   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/traffic_reports>
-   Is there any perturbations on the RER network ?
    -   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks/network:RER/traffic_reports>
-   Is there any perturbations on the "RER A" line ?
    -   <https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/fr-idf/networks/network:RER/lines/line:TRN:DUA810801043/traffic_reports>

The response is made of an array of [traffic_reports](#traffic-reports), and another one
of [disruptions](#disruption). There are inner links between this 2 arrays: see the
[inner-reference](#inner-reference) section to use them.

#### Objects

##### Traffic report

Traffic_reports is an array of some traffic_report object. One
traffic_report object is a complex object, made of a network, an array
of lines and an array of stop_areas. A typical traffic_report object
will contain:

-   1 network which is the grouping object
    -   it can contain links to its disruptions. These disruptions are globals and might not be applied on lines or stop_areas.
-   0..n lines
    -   each line contains at least a link to its disruptions
-   0..n stop_areas
    -   each stop_area contains at least a link to its disruptions

It means that if a stop_area is used by many networks, it will appear
many times.

Here is a typical response

Misc mechanisms (and few boring stuff)
--------------------------------------

### Multiple journeys

Navitia can compute several kind of trips within a journey query.

The
[RAPTOR](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=156567)
algorithm used in Navitia is a multi-objective algorithm. Thus it might
return multiple journeys if it cannot know that one is better than the
other. For example it cannot decide that a one hour trip with no
connection is better than a 45 minutes trip with one connection (it is
called the [pareto
front](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)).

If the user asks for more journeys than the number of journeys given by
RAPTOR (with the parameter `min_nb_journeys` or `count`), Navitia will
ask RAPTOR again, but for the following journeys (or the previous ones
if the user asked with `datetime_represents=arrival`).

Those journeys have the `next` (or `previous`) value in their tags.

### Journey qualification process

Since Navitia can return several journeys, it tags them to help the user
choose the best one for his needs.

The different journey types are:

|Type|Description|
|----|-----------|
|best|The best trip|
|rapid|A good trade off between duration, changes and constraint respect|
|no_train|Alternative trip without train|
|comfort|A trip with less changes and walking|
|car|A trip with car to get to the public transport|
|less_fallback_walk|A trip with less walking|
|less_fallback_bike|A trip with less biking|
|less_fallback_bss|A trip with less bss|
|fastest|A trip with minimum duration|
|non_pt_walk|A trip without public transport, only walking|
|non_pt_bike|A trip without public transport, only biking|
|non_pt_bss|A trip without public transport, only bike sharing|

### On demand transportation

Some transit agencies force travelers to call them to arrange a pickup at a particular place or stop point.

Besides, some stop times can be "estimated" *in data by design* :

- A standard GTFS contains only regular time: that means transport agencies should arrive on time :)
- But navitia can be fed with more specific data, where "estimated time" means that there will be
no guarantee on time respect by the agency. It often occurs in suburban or rural zone.

After all, the stop points can be standard (such as bus stop or railway station)
or "zonal" (where agency can pick you up you anywhere, like a cab).

That's some kind of "responsive locomotion" (ɔ).

So public transport lines can mix different methods to pickup travelers:

-   regular
    -   line does not contain any estimated stop times, nor zonal stop point location.
    -   No need to call too.
-   odt_with_stop_time
    -   line does not contain any estimated stop times, nor zonal stop point location.
    -   But you will have to call to take it.
-   odt_with_stop_point
    -   line can contain some estimated stop times, but no zonal stop point location.
    -   And you will have to call to take it.
-   odt_with_zone
    -   line can contain some estimated stop times, and zonal stop point location.
    -   And you will have to call to take it
    -   well, not really a public transport line, more a cab...
