Some important details
======================

Working on a specific region
----------------------------


In the first examples, the positions are given by coordinates and no network is specified.

However when no coordinates are provided, you need to provide on what region you want to request.

The list of region covered by *navitia* is available at <http://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage> . The shape of the region
is provided in [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/geojson-spec.html).
